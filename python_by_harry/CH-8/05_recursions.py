'''
Recursion is a function which calls itself.

It is used to directly use a mathematical formula as function.

############# The programmer needs to be extremely careful while working with recursion to ensure that the function doesnâ€™t infinitely keep calling itself. Recursion is sometimes the most direct way to code an algorithm.
